### 1. Introduction  
RNA-sequencing (*RNA-seq*) has a wide variety of applications. This popular transcriptome profiling technique can be used to quantify gene and isoform expression, detect alternative splicing events, predict gene-fusions, call variants and much more.

**RNA-seek** is a comprehensive, open-source RNA-seq pipeline that relies on technologies like [Docker<sup>20</sup>](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) and [Singularity<sup>21</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>19</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster or cloud provider. 

![RNA-seek_overview_diagram](https://github.com/skchronicles/RNA-seek/blob/main/resources/overview.svg)  
<sup>**Fig 1. Run locally on a compute instance, on-premise using a cluster, or on the cloud using AWS.** A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM, or run on AWS using Tibanna (feature coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. As an optional step, relevelant output files and metadata can be stored in object storage using HPC DME (NIH users) or Amazon S3 for archival purposes (coming soon!).</sup> 

### 2. Overview

#### 2.1 RNA-seek Pipeline
A bioinformatics pipeline is more than the sum of its data processing steps. A pipeline without quality-control steps provides a myopic view of the potential sources of variation within your data (i.e., biological verses technical sources of variation). RNA-seek pipeline is composed of a series of quality-control and data processing steps. 

The accuracy of the downstream interpretations made from transcriptomic data are highly dependent on initial sample library. Unwanted sources of technical variation, which if not accounted for properly, can influence the results. RNA-seek's comprehensive quality-control helps ensure your results are reliable and _reproducible across experiments_. In the data processing steps, RNA-seek quantifies gene and isoform expression and predicts gene fusions. Please note that the detection of alternative splicing events and variant calling will be incorporated in a later release.


![RNA-seq quantification pipeline](https://github.com/skchronicles/RNA-seek/blob/main/resources/RNA-seek_Pipeline.svg) <sup>**Fig 2. An Overview of RNA-seek Pipeline.** Gene and isoform counts are quantified and a series of QC-checks are performed to assess the quality of the data. This pipeline stops at the generation of a raw counts matrix and gene-fusion calling. To run the pipeline, a user must select their raw data, a reference genome, and output directory (i.e., the location where the pipeline performs the analysis). Quality-control information is summarized across all samples in a MultiQC report.</sup> 

**Quality Control**   
[*FastQC*<sup>2</sup>](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is used to assess the sequencing quality. FastQC is run twice, before and after adapter trimming. It generates a set of basic statistics to identify problems that can arise during sequencing or library preparation. FastQC will summarize per base and per read QC metrics such as quality scores and GC content. It will also summarize the distribution of sequence lengths and will report the presence of adapter sequences.
 
[*Kraken2*<sup>14</sup>](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) and [*FastQ Screen*<sup>17</sup>](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/) are used to screen for various sources of contamination. During the process of sample collection to library preparation, there is a risk for introducing wanted sources of DNA. FastQ Screen compares your sequencing data to a set of different reference genomes to determine if there is contamination. It allows a user to see if the composition of your library matches what you expect. Also, if there are high levels of microbial contamination, Kraken can provide an estimation of the taxonomic composition. Kraken can be used in conjunction with [*Krona*<sup>15</sup>](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki/KronaTools) to produce interactive reports.

[*Preseq*<sup>1</sup>](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/) is used to estimate the complexity of a library for each samples. If the duplication rate is very high, the overall library complexity will be low. Low library complexity could signal an issue with library preparation where very little input RNA was over-amplified or the sample may be degraded.

[*Picard*<sup>10</sup>](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) can be used to estimate the duplication rate, and it has another particularly useful sub-command called CollectRNAseqMetrics which reports the number and percentage of reads that align to various regions: such as coding, intronic, UTR, intergenic and ribosomal regions. This is particularly useful as you would expect a library constructed with ploy(A)-selection to have a high percentage of reads that map to coding regions. Picard CollectRNAseqMetrics will also report the uniformity of coverage across all genes, which is useful for determining whether a sample has a 3' bias (observed in ploy(A)-selection libraries containing degraded RNA).

[*RSeQC*<sup>9</sup>](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/) is another particularity useful package that is tailored for RNA-seq data. It is used to calculate the inner distance between paired-end reads and calculate TIN values for a set of canonical protein-coding transcripts. A median TIN value is calucated for each sample, which analogous to a computationally derived RIN.

[MultiQC<sup>11</sup>](https://multiqc.info/) is used to aggreate the results of each tool into a single interactive report.  

**Quantification**  
[*Cutadapt*<sup>3</sup>](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used to remove adapter sequences, perform quality trimming, and remove very short sequences that would otherwise multi-map all over the genome prior to alignment. 

[*STAR*<sup>4</sup>](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) is used to align reads to the reference genome. The RNA-seek pipeline runs STAR in a two-passes where splice-junctions are collected and aggregated across all samples and provided to the second-pass of STAR. In the second pass of STAR, the splice-junctions detected in the first pass are inserted into the genome indices prior to alignment.

[*RSEM*<sup>5</sup>](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM) is used to quantify gene and isoform expression. The expected counts from RSEM are merged across samples to create a two counts matrices for gene counts and isoform counts.

[*Arriba*<sup>22</sup>](https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to predict gene-fusion events. The pre-built human and mouse reference genomes use Arriba blacklists to reduce the false-positive rate.

#### 2.2 Reference Genomes
Reference files are pulled from an S3 bucket to the compute instance or local filesystem prior to execution.  
RNA-seek comes bundled with pre-built reference files for the following genomes:
| Name     | Species | Genome | Annotation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------- | 
| hg38_30  | Homo sapiens (human) | [GRCh38](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_28/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz) | [Gencode<sup>6</sup> Release 30](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_30/gencode.v30.annotation.gtf.gz) |
| mm10_M21 | Mus musculus (mouse) | [GRCm38](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M18/GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz) | [Gencode Release M21](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M21/gencode.vM21.annotation.gtf.gz) |

> **Warning:** This section contains FTP links for downloading each reference file.  Open the link in a new tab to start a download. 

#### 2.3 Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake>=6.0` 

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee reproducibility, each step relies on pre-built images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/nciccbr/repositories). Snakemake uses singaularity to pull these images onto the local filesystem prior to job execution, and as so, snakemake and singularity are the only two dependencies.
