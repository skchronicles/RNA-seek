### About

This report contains the results of differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using the R bioconductor package [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). 

This report includes data pre-processing steps to filter out lowly expressed genes, estimate scaling factors for normalization, and transform the raw counts into log2 counts per million (log2CPM) values using the `voom` method to account for mean-variance relationship in RNA-seq data. After data normalization, exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to examine inter-sample clustering and detect potential outliers.

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the limma functions `lmFit`, `contrasts.fit`, and `eBayes`. The differential expression results are presented in interactive tables and volcano plots for each comparison of interest.

The sample sheet above links each sample to its associated metadata. It includes a **Group** column representing the experimental groups of interest— such as time points, treatments, conditions, genotypes status, or disease states. The **Group** information is used to construct the design matrix for linear modeling in [`limma`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html), enabling comparisons between groups to identify differentially expressed genes.

### Pre-processing

#### Filtering

Before identifying differentially expressed genes, it is important to remove lowly expressed genes. 

As the author of `limma` notes:

> Genes not expressed at biologically meaningful levels in any condition are uninformative and should be excluded. Statistically, filtering out low-count genes improves estimation of the mean–variance relationship and reduces the number of tests performed during differential expression analysis.

#### Normalization

Differential expression analysis **should not** be performed on raw counts. Raw counts are biased by library size (i.e sequencing depth): samples with greater sequencing depth yield higher counts. To correct for this, counts are normalized to account for sequencing depth and transformed to `log2(CPM + pseudocount)` using `limma::voom()`. The `voom()` function adds a small pseudocount (0.5) to avoid taking the log of zero.

Normalization also ensures comparable expression distributions across samples. The trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method, implemented in `edgeR::calcNormFactors()`, calculates scaling factors applied to library sizes. This step is essential to remove systematic biases that can arise from differences in sequencing depth or RNA composition between samples. Without proper normalization, any observed differences in expression may reflect technical artifacts rather than true biological variation.

RNA-sequencing counts exhibit a mean–variance relationship: variance increases with mean count. Modeling this heteroscedasticity is essential. While methods using the Negative Binomial distribution assume a quadratic mean–variance relationship, limma models log2CPM values as approximately normally distributed. `limma::voom()` estimates the mean–variance trend in log-counts, assigns precision weights based on predicted variance, and incorporates these weights in linear modeling to adjust for heteroscedasticity. Accurately modeling this relationship increases statistical power and reduces false discoveries, ensuring that identified differentially expressed genes reflect true biological differences rather than variation caused by count magnitude or technical noise.

```

The red line in the voom plot above represents the estimated mean–variance trend used to calculate precision weights for each gene and sample in limma. The plot typically shows a decreasing relationship between mean expression and variance. Flatter curves indicate greater biological variation, while steeper declines suggest more consistent expression across replicates. 

Moreover, the voom-plot provides a visual check on the level of filtering performed upstream. If filtering of lowly-expressed genes is insufficient, a drop in variance levels can be observed at the low end of the expression scale due to very small counts. If this is observed, additional filtering step should be performed proir to running voom.

The interactive 3D PCA plot above visualizes the clustering of samples based on the first three principal components (PCs) of the normalized gene expression data. Each point represents a sample, colored by the variable selected in the drop down. The axes indicate the percentage of variance explained by each PC, providing insights into the major sources of variation in the dataset.

### Differential gene expression analysis

This experiment aims to identify genes that are differentially expressed between experimental groups of interest.

Group comparisons are defined as contrasts, and differential expression is assessed using the R package [`limma`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). The functions `limma::lmFit()`, `limma::contrasts.fit()`, and `limma::eBayes()` fit linear models to each gene and apply empirical Bayes moderation to improve the variance estimates by borrowing information across all genes. This step is important because it stabilizes the variance estimates (especially when sample sizes are small) leading to more reliable detection of truly differentially expressed genes. P-values are then adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method.

#### Comparisons of interest

Here is a table containing the differential expression comparisons to perform. Each row represents a comparison between two experimental groups. The control group represents the baseline group of the comparison.

###### Results 

**{{grp1}}** _**vs.**_ **{{grp2}}**

<details>
  <summary>*Interpreting the fold-change*</summary>
    If a gene has a positive fold-change (FC) value, it indicates that the gene is <span style="color:green">**up-regulated** (i.e its expression is higher)</span> in the `{{grp1}}` group compared to the `{{grp2}}` group. Conversely, a negative FC value indicates that the gene is <span style="color:red">**down-regulated** (i.e its expression is lower)</span> in the `{{grp1}}` group compared to the `{{grp2}}` group.

#### Differential expression results {.tabset}

The following sections present the differential gene expression results for each comparison. Each comparison includes two tabs: one with filtered results (i.e. Results) and another tab showing a volcano plot highlighting the top differentially expressed genes (i.e. Volcano Plot). 

Only significant genes are shown, defined by an **FDR-adjusted p-value ≤ `r fdr.threshold`** and **abs(fold change) ≥ `r fc.threshold`**. The complete, unfiltered results for each comparison are also available as a TSV file.
